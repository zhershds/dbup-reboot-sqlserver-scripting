# DbUp Reboot SQL Server Object Scripting

It is a combination of two nice solutions for dbUp library:
1) https://github.com/bradymholt/dbup-sqlserver-scripting
2) https://github.com/chriswill/DbUpReboot

**dbup-sqlserver-scripting** project was used as a basic one with upgrading to .NET Standard. **dbUp.*** packages were replaced by **DbUpReboot.*** packages as a more modern alternative.
